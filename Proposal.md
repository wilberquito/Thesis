# A platform for Melanoma classifer

The goal of the project is to create a platform
that exposses Melanoma deep learner models
throw an API. The project will have some models already
trainned from the VICOROBOT UdG group and some of them
trainned by myself. Along with the API, I'll create an
user interface to load images and allow user make inference.
The UI will also give information to the user about
the distribution of probabilities to being Melanoma or being
from other classes.

More than having incredible results, the projec seeks a way
to expose the use of deep learning technologies.
All this infrastructure will run over the Docker technology,
and hosted in any hosting service or in any of my machines.

This project perfectly fits into as master thesis
in data science because one of the pilars
is how to take profit from data of different kinds
and knowing the technologies we need to use to acomplish that.
Talking about the technologies, the deep learning part of the
project will run over Pytorch, the API will be created using
python and the framework FastAPI, the user interface will be
made with SvelteKit which is framework to create web applications.

The project will be guided by VICOROBOT lab and people from
Acenture company.
