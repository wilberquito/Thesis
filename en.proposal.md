# A platform for Melanoma classifer

The goal of this project is to create a platform that
exposes Melanoma deep learning models through an API.
The project will have some models pre-trained by the
VICOROBOT UdG group and others trained by myself.
In addition to the API, I will create a user interface
to load images and allow users to make inferences.
The UI will also provide information to the user
about the distribution of probabilities of the images
of being Melanoma or being from other classes.

More than producing incredible results,
the project seeks to showcase the use of deep learning technologies.
All of this infrastructure will run on Docker technology and
will be hosted on any hosting service or on any of my machines.

This project is a perfect fit for a master's thesis
in data science because one of the pillars of this
master is how to leverage data of different kinds and knowing
the technologies we need to use to accomplish that.
Regarding the technologies, the deep learning
part of the project will run on PyTorch,
the API will be created using Python and the
FastAPI framework, and the user interface
will be built with SvelteKit, which is a
framework for creating web applications.

The project will be supervised by the teacher Dr. Garcia Campos, Rafael,
in the VICOROBOT lab and professionals from Accenture.
