# Overfitting vs Underfitting

First, let's clarify that bias-variance tradeoff and overfitting-underfitting are equivalent.

## Where does it steam for?

The overall idea behind the ML system is to model the hidden distribution of a data set from the samples collected. If you sample enough from the distribution, you can get a fairly accurate re-creation of the distribution as shown below.
