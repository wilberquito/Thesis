\chapter{Results}
\label{cap:result}

In this chapter, we present the results of various machine learning
approaches used to train the models discussed in \textit{Chapter \ref{cap:contrib}}.
These results are presented using tables and visualizations to
facilitate understanding the benefits and limitations of each decision. The tables and visualizations,
provide a concise and comparative summary of the performance metrics, such as accuracy, AUC and recall. \\

Additionally, we showcase the outcomes of the CAD infrastructure constructed around this thesis.
