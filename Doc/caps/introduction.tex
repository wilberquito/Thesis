\section{Problem Statement}

Skin cancer, including melanoma, represents a significant public health concern worldwide. Melanoma, in particular, poses a considerable challenge due to its high mortality rate and the need for early detection for successful treatment. Early and correct diagnosis is key for ensuring patients have the best possible prognosis.
Melanoma misdiagnosis accounts for more pathology and dermatology malpractice claims than any
cancer other than breast cancer, as an early misdiagnosis can significantly reduce a patientâ€™s chances of
survival \cite{Melanoma}. \\

Dermoscopy, also known as dermatoscopy \textit{Figure \ref{fig:procedure_dermoscopy}}, is a noninvasive technique widely utilized for the examination of cutaneous lesions. It involves the use of a handheld instrument called a dermatoscope to visualize subsurface skin structures that are typically not visible to the naked eye. The dermatoscope illuminates the skin surface and provides magnification, allowing for a detailed examination of the epidermis, the dermoepidermal junction, and the papillary dermis. By analyzing these structures, dermatologists can identify specific features and patterns associated with various skin conditions, including melanoma \cite{Dermoscopy}.

\end{figure}

Worldwide, in 2020 an estimated 324,635 people were diagnosed with melanoma and an estimated 57,043 people worldwide died from melanoma the same year \cite{CancerStats}. The introduction of sophisticated machinery and techniques in dermoscopy procedures \textit{Figure \ref{fig:subset_isic}} seems not enough to fight against melanoma, but the developments in artificial intelligence (AI) especially in deep learning techniques, have made Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD)\footnote{Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) refers to the use of computer algorithms and technologies to assist healthcare professionals in the process of medical diagnosis} a promising path towards medical automation.

However, there are several limitations that raise doubts about the effectiveness of automated melanoma cancer classifiers and their suitability for integration into the medical system. Firstly, certain methods are constructed based on theoretical models of melanoma appearance, which may restrict their applicability to specific morphologies and fail to capture the wide range of variations seen in real-world scenarios. Secondly, AI systems utilized in these classifiers are trained to address a singular and narrow task. Unlike human dermatologists, these systems lack the ability to consider holistic patient information when formulating a final diagnosis, reflecting the concept of weak AI \cite{WeakAI}. Lastly, numerous methods have been trained and evaluated using high-quality image frames, which may result in instability when applied under real-time visibility conditions where image quality is often compromised. A fundamental part of machine learning is the problem of generalization, that
is, how to make sure that a trained model performs well on unseen data. If the
unseen data has different distribution, i.e. a domain shift exists, the problem is
significantly more difficult even the smallest changes in the statistics
as compared to the training data can cause a deep neural network to fail completely \cite{DomainShift}. \\

Addressing these limitations and developing melanoma cancer classifiers that encompass a wider range of morphologies, incorporate holistic patient information, consider relevant elements, and demonstrate robustness in real-world scenarios are crucial for improving the reliability and effectiveness of melanoma detection and diagnosis systems. \\

\section{Project Objectives}

The main objective of this project is to create a health care infrastructure, focused on melanoma detection using deep learning methods to train
a system capable of detecting melanoma on dermoscopy images to test the ability
of computer-assisted image analysis. To this end, the gradual achievements
that must be accomplished are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the theory behind deep learning and its practical applications.
    \item Analyzing images from dermostocopy and understanding its most important features.
    \item Train deep learning models with different techniques based on tranfer-learning focused on the images of the melanoma ISIC Challenge \cite{IsicChallenge}.
    \item Developing a CAD system. The CAD system contains the already trained models with a simple web UI\footnote{The user interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device} an API\footnote{API stands for Application Programming Interface} and finally a mechanism using Docker to virtualize this services making it ease to deploy in any based Linux System.
\end{itemize}

\section{Personal Motivation}

I envisioned this project as a unique fusion of three personal passions. Firstly, I was fueled by a deep fascination with human cognition and reasoning. Machines, in my eyes, represented a novel paradigm through which I could delve further into this captivating realm. \\

I am also motivated by the remarkable problem-solving capacity of data. Regardless of its structure, data holds immense potential to uncover hidden patterns, provide insights, and drive innovation. The ability to extract meaningful information from data, regardless of its form, inspires me to constantly expand my knowledge and skills in order to contribute to the field of data science and make a tangible difference in the world. \\

Last but not least, I am driven by the immense power of automation and its ability to democratize access to research knowledge. I am amazed by how automation processes can extract value and make them readily available to professionals and the public alike.

I acknowledge the importance of academic integrity and the consequences of plagiarism. Hence, I affirm that all the information, data, results, figures, and conclusions presented in this thesis are authentic and original. Any references or sources used have been appropriately cited and referenced.

\section{Regulatory Framework}

The inclusion of legal considerations has become a significant aspect of the field of medical imaging. Privacy concerns and the potential misuse of personal information make sharing and distributing medical data particularly challenging. To address these limitations, recent research collaborations have focused on promoting the sharing of patient data through de-identification methods. However, it is crucial to thoroughly analyze the obligations related to the protection of individuals and their personal data before engaging in projects involving medical imaging. \\

When working with medical images, it is the utmost importance to prioritize patient privacy rights. In the context of developing a skin lesions database, it is necessary to obtain signed consent from patients for the publication of their data. For this thesis, the ISIC Archive database was utilized, this database serves as a publicly accessible resource for teaching, research, and the development and testing of diagnostic artificial intelligence algorithms, and it resolves any concerns related to consent \cite{IsicArchive}. It is a large and continually expanding open-source archive of skin images.

\section{Contribution to Melanoma Detection}

In this section, we present the contribution to the field of melanoma detection through the development of a melanoma CAD (Computer-Aided Diagnosis) infrastructure classifier. \\

The thesis comprises multiple models employing various techniques, including transfer learning, data augmentation, just-in-time testing, regularization, and others. To compare these models, tools like W\&B (Weight \& Biases), a MLOps platform for experiment tracking, and MLXTEND, providing utilities and extensions for machine learning and data science in Python's scientific computing stack, were utilized. The experiments were conducted using the ISIC Archive dataset, consisting of benign and malignant skin lesions. Prior to analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to enhance quality and normalize features. Consequently, accurate classification and differentiation of melanoma lesions from benign ones were achieved. \\

In order to improve the distribution and usability of all models, two services were developed. These services include a user-friendly UI and an API, both of which were containerized using Docker technology. By containerizing the UI, an intuitive and interactive user experience was provided, enabling users to seamlessly interact with the melanoma CAD system. Similarly, containerizing the API streamlined request handling and prediction serving, resulting in efficient performance. This approach facilitated easy deployment across various platforms.
