\section{Manual Installation}
\label{appendix:appendix_a}

We will provide you with the necessary tools to install the CAD infrastructure.
You won't have to worry about managing the installation of Python packages and NPM packages,
as we have created images that include all the required packages for seamless execution. \\

Although you need some tools for the installation process,
these tools are specifically for building the project and are independent of the services created. \\

This example employs Fedora Linux 38 as the operating system; however,
all the tools used for building the platform are cross-platform, ensuring smooth execution on other operating systems as well. \\

The tools you will need for the installation are these:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Git
  \item Docker or Podman
  \item docker-compose
  \item CURL
\end{itemize}
