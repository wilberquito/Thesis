# Hello services!

You need docker compose.
I am using [podman](https://docs.oracle.com/en/learn/podman-compose/index.html#create-a-docker-compose-file).

If you are using `Ubunut`, here are the instructions to install
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

## Run the services

```bash
sudo podman-compose up -d
```

## Shut the services

```bash
sudo podman-compose down
```
